Overview
========

For information about the Composible Operational Workflows project, see http://www.wiredwidgets.org/cow

The COW Agile Client plugins are a representative prototype of a Netbeans-based client to manage workflows and complete assigned tasks.  It connects to a COW server (see https://bitbucket.org/wjk5828/wiredwidgets-cow-server) via REST calls defined by the COW Server API (https://bitbucket.org/wjk5828/wiredwidgets-cow-server-api). The plugins are designed to run in the AgileClient platform (a customized Netbeans 6.9.1 platform) but could be tweaked to work with any "vanilla" Netbeans platform.

There are three Netbeans modules (NBMs) that are contained within a single module suite.  All three are needed to function.

* cow-ac-client: the core module which contains all the source code for the actual client
* cow-ac-libs: wraps dependency libraries needed for Spring, message handling, server notifications, logging, and so forth
* cow-server-api: wraps the cow-server-api jar into a NBM which provides access to java and the REST calls in use by the server


Building
========

Requirements:
* Most easily built in Netbeans 7.1 
* JDK 1.6
* Agile Client 4.2.0.5 R2

Additional environments will work with minimal adjustment, but the above is the development team's standard environment.

Build Steps:
* Open Netbeans
* Open the Netbeans Module Suite project in Netbeans (File -> Open Project, browse to the location of the "cow-ac-suite" folder). Optionally open up each of the three modules in the suite.
* Ensure that a JDK 1.6 Java Platform and the AgileClient Netbeans Platform are registered with Netbeans (Tools -> Java Platforms, Tools -> Netbeans Platforms).
* Right-click the cow-ac-suite suite project and open the project "Properties".
* Set the Java and Netbeans platforms under the "Libraries" setting.
* Right-click the cow-ac-suite project and select "Clean and Build All". (There may be some project warnings, but should be no errors.)
* Right-click the cow-ac-suite project and select "Package As -> NBMs" to build the nbm files. Note the location of the built files in the output window.

Loading in Agile Client:
* Open AgileClient and add all three created nbm files by using the plugin manager (Tools->Plugins, go to the "Downloaded" tab and click the "Add Plugins..." button).
* Install the plugins, accepting the licensing agreement.

The COW-related windows should now be available for activation from the "Window" Menu in AgileClient.  

The server settings and user name must be set in "Tools -> Options" in the COW panel before use.
